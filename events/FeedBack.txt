DASHBOARD:
  - "Google Calendar" change the letters to white instead of black. The black makes it hard to read with the red background.
  - Recommended | Friends | All 
      - I guess I have to implement the algorithm to have events being recommended by friends 
        since we already have an algorithm for RecommendedEvents and to show all events.
  
PROFILE - CREATION:
  - I love it.
  - If we add fields to createUser.php as major, year_user_is_in, or organizations_user_belongs_to, then we could recommmend friends which
    have the same fields (major, year_user_is_in, or organizations_user_belongs_to)  
    to the user as part of the process of creating the user's profile.
  - Having friends recommendations as well, will make easy to recommend events according to the user's list of friends.
    
  
CREATE USER:
  - How are you defining the user type as $_POST['type'] or how? I need to add this to my code to handle
    organizations and individuals.
    
FRIENDS:
  - How are we handling user's friends?
  - If the user is going to add friends to his profile, we can add a search bar for friends. 
    Where the user will be able to search by firstname, lastname or email.
    It will show all users in the user_table with the name, lastname or email that matches the search.
    If you like this idea or have a better idea, let me know to implement it. 
    
    
NOTE: 
 -  I will work on my code this thursday, please let me know before hand to know what I have to implement.
